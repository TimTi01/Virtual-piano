:musical_keyboard: This is a virtual piano slider app with a track selection.(Demo video below)

App Features:
* Sound playback when pressing the white and black keys, as well as animation of pressing the keys.
* Play the track indicated on the slider. In total, there are three start/pause/stop modes. Control is carried out using the buttons on the piano panel.
* Above the track playback panel is a color indicator indicating the track playback modes (green, yellow, red).
* The piano has an automatic track playback function, but this function is currently in test mode and only plays the intro before the breakdown.
* It is possible to disable the automatic playback of the track by using the checkbox. The checkbox is located below the track playback panel (under the "pause" button)

This application needs some modifications and improvements. There is only one reason for this, it is the lack of normal sounds for the notes. Everything had to be tuned by ear.

What I want to add in the future:
1. Set up a similar sound to a real piano, or add audio API.
2. Replace images with videos from any video hosting service.
